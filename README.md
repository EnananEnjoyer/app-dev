  # Here is my top 3 favorite characters in this series / universe. 
  1. Ryougi Shiki = The reason she is my favorite is because of how well written yet simple her character is. She's badass and has amazing powers that can decapitate anyone.
  2. Kama = She is one of my favorite Servant in the game Fate Grand Order. She deals alot of damage, has great skills and most importantly is a great character even if she's mostly a villain when she has a screen time.
  3. Kiritsugu Emiya = He's one of the many cool characters in the series. He's rutless, kills to save many and strived to became a hero of justice until he got reality checked by his own ideal.
